## Deep Learning for Stock Prediction: A Study of The Theory & Implementation


This repository contains the implementation of Amar Allaham's final project for the University of London Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The goal of this project is to develop a multi-stock prediction system that streamlines the process of creating and training deep learning models for predicting stock trends across multiple stocks.

### Contents:

1. Stock Prediction Project_implementation.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation of the project, showcasing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and stock trend predictions.

2. stockPred.py: A custom Python library that includes all the helper functions used in the project, facilitating various operations like data preparation, feature engineering, and model training.
