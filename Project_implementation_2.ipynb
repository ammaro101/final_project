The 5 stocks we will work with are chosen based on their ranking in this list from most valuable to least valuable, and each one is relatively distant from the other and belongs to a different industry. This will ensure a diverse sample and that our model evaluation results generalize relatively well, reducing the possibility of bias and overfitting.\n",

For the period value, we will set it to 10 years or max value which will be sufficient for all of our experiments, for the interval value however, which determines the frequency of the data rows, we will experiment with many options to see if our approach generalizes better with specific interval values as different intervals are relevant to other groups of financial analysts and traders in the real world, therefore we must try to create the best model relevant to each of these groups.\n",

    "That's why we will define a function that allows us to download any number of stock data at any period or interval, save the data as a CSV file to local storage, load it from storage, split it into different data frames based on the stock, and organize the data frames in a dictionary so it's easy to work with for the rest of the project.\n",
